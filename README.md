# ForbiddenHack v1.0.0 üöÄ

**Advanced 403 Bypass & Reconnaissance Tool**

ForbiddenHack is a comprehensive Python tool designed for security researchers and penetration testers to test and bypass HTTP 403 Forbidden responses using multiple attack vectors including header manipulation, HTTP method testing, path obfuscation, and historical snapshot analysis.

## Features

### üéØ Multi-Vector Bypass Testing
- **Header-based Bypass**: Tests various HTTP headers that may bypass access controls
- **HTTP Method Testing**: Attempts different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- **Path Obfuscation**: Advanced URL manipulation techniques including:
  - Case sensitivity variations
  - Character encoding (URL encoding, double encoding)
  - Slash tricks and directory traversal
  - File extension manipulation
  - Special character injection

### üï∞Ô∏è Historical Analysis
- **Wayback Machine Integration**: Discovers historical snapshots of restricted resources
- **Timeline Analysis**: Shows when protected resources were previously accessible

### üé® User Experience
- **Colorized Output**: Easy-to-read results with color-coded status responses
- **Multiple Banner Designs**: Randomized ASCII art banners
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive results with response lengths and headers
- **Configurable Delays**: Adjustable request timing to avoid rate limiting

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip package manager

### Quick Install
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BlackForgeX/ForbiddenHack.git
cd ForbiddenHack

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make executable (Linux/macOS)
chmod +x main.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python main.py -u http://example.com/admin
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
python main.py -u https://target.com/restricted -d 0.5 -t 10
```

### Flags
- `-u, --url`: Target URL (required)
- `-d, --delay`: Delay between requests in seconds (default: 0.2)
- `-t, --timeout`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 8.0)

## Examples

### Testing a Restricted Admin Panel
```bash
python main.py -u https://example.com/admin
```

### Testing with Custom Timing
```bash
# Slower requests to avoid detection
python main.py -u https://target.com/secret -d 1.0 -t 15
```

### Testing API Endpoints
```bash
python main.py -u https://api.example.com/v1/users
```

## Bypass Techniques

### Header-Based Bypasses
- `X-Original-URL`: Override the original URL
- `X-Rewrite-URL`: URL rewriting bypass
- `X-Forwarded-*`: IP and host forwarding headers
- `X-Real-IP`: Real IP header manipulation
- `Referer/Origin`: Referrer-based bypasses

### HTTP Method Variations
Tests multiple HTTP methods including:
- Standard methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS
- WebDAV methods: PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE, LOCK, UNLOCK
- Extended methods: TRACE, CONNECT, PATCH

### Path Obfuscation Categories
1. **Case Sensitivity**: Upper/lower case variations
2. **Character Encoding**: URL encoding with hex variations
3. **Slash Tricks**: Double slashes, trailing slashes, backslashes
4. **Directory Traversal**: Various `../` and `./` combinations
5. **File Extensions**: Adding common file extensions (.json, .php, .html)
6. **Special Characters**: Null bytes, Unicode, and control characters

## Output Interpretation

### Status Code Colors
- üü¢ **Green (2xx)**: Successful responses - **POSSIBLE BYPASS**
- üü° **Yellow (3xx)**: Redirects - May indicate partial bypass
- üî¥ **Red (4xx)**: Client errors - Access still forbidden
- üü£ **Purple (5xx)**: Server errors - May indicate successful confusion
- üîµ **Blue (Other)**: Unexpected responses

### Key Indicators
- **Length Variations**: Different response lengths may indicate bypass
- **POSSIBLE BYPASS**: Highlighted when 200 OK is returned
- **Redirect Analysis**: Shows redirect targets for 3xx responses
